# 1. Blockchain Fundamentals:

## Multiple Choice Questions (MCQs)

1. **What is the primary purpose of blockchain in transactional systems?**

   - To replace all existing financial institutions
   - To provide coordination between parties when no single trusted party exists
   - To increase the speed of centralized banking systems
   - To eliminate the need for cryptography in transactions  
     **Correct Answer:** To provide coordination between parties when no single trusted party exists

2. **Which of the following is NOT a problem with centralized trust systems?**

   - Single point of failure
   - High transparency
   - Power misuse
   - Vulnerability to attacks  
     **Correct Answer:** High transparency

3. **How does blockchain achieve decentralization?**

   - By relying on a single powerful server
   - By distributing trust across a network of nodes
   - By eliminating all forms of consensus mechanisms
   - By centralizing data storage in one location  
     **Correct Answer:** By distributing trust across a network of nodes

4. **What is the role of a "nonce" in a blockchain block?**

   - It stores the list of transactions
   - It is the result of the Proof of Work (PoW) consensus mechanism
   - It acts as the block's unique identifier
   - It links the block to the next block in the chain  
     **Correct Answer:** It is the result of the Proof of Work (PoW) consensus mechanism

5. **Which blockchain characteristic ensures that recorded transactions cannot be altered?**

   - Decentralization
   - Transparency
   - Immutability
   - Scalability  
     **Correct Answer:** Immutability

6. **What was the key innovation introduced by Ethereum (Blockchain 2.0)?**

   - Proof of Work (PoW)
   - Smart contracts
   - Cryptographic hashing
   - Centralized governance  
     **Correct Answer:** Smart contracts

7. **Which type of blockchain is fully open and permissionless?**

   - Private blockchain
   - Consortium blockchain
   - Public blockchain
   - Hybrid blockchain  
     **Correct Answer:** Public blockchain

8. **What happens if a hacker tries to alter data in a block in the middle of the chain?**

   - Only that block's hash changes
   - The entire chain becomes invalid
   - The network automatically corrects the alteration
   - The subsequent blocks remain unaffected  
     **Correct Answer:** The entire chain becomes invalid

9. **Which of the following is a real-world application of blockchain in supply chain management?**

   - Bitcoin transactions
   - ID2020 digital identity
   - IBM Food Trust
   - Ethereum smart contracts  
     **Correct Answer:** IBM Food Trust

10. **What consensus mechanism was introduced by Bitcoin to validate transactions?**
    - Proof of Stake (PoS)
    - Proof of Work (PoW)
    - Delegated Proof of Stake (DPoS)
    - Practical Byzantine Fault Tolerance (PBFT)  
      **Correct Answer:** Proof of Work (PoW)

   - False  
     **Correct Answer:** False

2. **In a private blockchain, governance is fully decentralized like in public blockchains.**

   - True
   - False  
     **Correct Answer:** False

3. **The 2008 financial crisis highlighted the risks of centralized trust systems.**

   - True
   - False  
     **Correct Answer:** True

4. **Ethereum was the first blockchain platform to introduce Proof of Work (PoW).**

   - True
   - False  
     **Correct Answer:** False

5. **Changing a single block in the blockchain requires altering all subsequent blocks.**
   - True
   - False  
     **Correct Answer:** True
